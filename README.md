# ECSE324-Lab2-ARMAssembly-Algorithms

ARMv7 assembly implementations for basic I/O operations, Euclidean GCD, insertion sort, recursive binary search, and Gaussian-filtered image downsampling. Developed for ECSE 324 Lab 2 using the DE1-SoC simulator to practice low-level programming, function calls, and performance optimization.

## Contents
- **Task 1:** Euclidean GCD algorithm in ARM assembly, handling zero inputs and returning the correct greatest common divisor.
- **Task 2:** Insertion sort for signed 16-bit integers, sorting in ascending order directly in memory.
- **Task 3:** Recursive binary search for unique 32-bit integers, following ARM calling conventions and preserving registers.

## Tools & Environment
- **Simulator:** DE1-SoC Computer System web-based emulator
- **Processor:** ARMv7 (Cortex-A9)
- **Assembly Syntax:** ARM and Thumb-2 Instruction Set
- **References:**
  - ARMv7-AR Architecture Reference Manual
  - ARM & Thumb-2 Quick Reference Card
  - DE1-SoC Computer Manual

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding ARM assembly syntax and addressing modes
- Implementing function calls with BL and BX LR instructions
- Preserving register states using PUSH/POP
- Optimizing arithmetic with bitwise operations
- Applying image processing filters at the assembly level
